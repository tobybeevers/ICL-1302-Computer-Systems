# ICL-1302-Computer-Systems #
This is the start of my journey into understanding Computer Systems, this is a record of my assignments as part of my APPLIED DATA SCIENCE DEGREE APPRENTICESHIP BSC (HONS). Feel free to take a look and use the files, more than happy to share and help people on their own journey.

### Assignment One ###
Desktop PC hardware

*Description*
For this exercise, you need to demonstrate a basic understanding of  the key functional elements of a desktop computer. 
For each of the elements listed below, you must provide a relevant graphic and a brief explanation of the function of that element. If you have pictures taken during the PC hardware practical exercise, you may use these. Otherwise you will source pictures from the internet.
The elements to be covered are:
1. Motherboard
2. Processor (CPU)
3. Power supply
4. Memory (RAM)
5. Permanent storage (HDD or SSD)
6. Network interface
7. Graphics interfac

### Assignment Two ###
Computer System Architecture

*Description*
For this exercise, you will create a presentation using PowerPoint (or equivalent) to explain how key computing functions are implemented in the hardware of two different devices:
 - Desktop Computer
 - Smartphone

For example, the display on a desktop PC would typically be a separate monitor but this is integrated into a smartphone. A desktop PC is generally controlled differently to a smartphone.
You will decide the exact content and format of the presentation but you must cover:
 - Input / Output
 - Memory
 - Storage
 - Processor

The presentation should contain no more than 10 slides (excluding a title screen). 

### Assignment Three ###
Data Representation

*Description*
For this exercise, you will create a handout (no more than 2 sides of A4) aimed at students starting a course at college to explain about data management. 
In particular, you need to explain how storage at college with the H: drive differs from the computer that the student may have at home.
The areas to be covered are:
 - What is the H: drive and why is data stored there and not on the PCâ€™s C: drive?
 - Why students need to ensure their work is backed up
 - Options for backing up data (e.g. USB, cloud)
 - How to correctly use USB storage devices
 - Guidance on naming of files and folders including any characters that cannot be used.
 - Overview of file types that students will encounter on their course and the file extensions associated with them.
 - Explanation of how storage is measured e.g. bits, bytes, Megabytes, Gigabytes etc.

You may find it useful to include images /diagrams in your handout.

### Assignment Four ###
Specify a computer to meet a requirement

*Description*
For a Pass grade on this exercise, you will select a currently available computer system and demonstrate its suitability for running Battlefield 1.
It is important that you clearly identify the minimum hardware and software requirements for the game. You should also identify if there are higher recommended specifications.
You must then provide evidence that your chosen computer system meets or exceeds each of the minimum requirements. If there are higher recommended specifications, you should also comment on the extent to which the system meets these.
For higher grades, select two computer systems; one lower cost / lower specification system which meets the minimum requirements for playing the game and another higher cost / higher specification system which meets the recommended game specifications. Compare the systems and explain the differences between them.

### Assignment Five ###
Operating System Generic Functionality

*Description*
In an earlier exercise, you explained various hardware aspects of a computer system, namely:
 - Input / Output
 - Memory
 - Storage
 - Processor
For this exercise, you must explain how an operating system controls each of these areas of hardware.
While you can and should use specific examples and screenshots, you should not focus on a single operating system but instead look at generic functions present in any operating system.
Be sure to identify clearly the part of an operating system that controls each area of hardware.
Also explain the difference between the following software types:
 - applications
 - operating systems
 - device drivers

### Assignment Six ###
Operating System Comparison

*Description*
In Exercise 5 you identified the specific parts of an operating system that control aspects of computer hardware.
For this exercise, you will look in more detail at how these have been implemented in two specific operating systems. Choose ONE column from this table and compare those two systems:
| A      | B      | C      | D       | E      |
|--------|--------|--------|---------|--------|
|Android |Android |iOS     |Mac OS X |Android |
|iOS     |Windows |Windows |Windows  |Mac OS  |
 
*The assignment where weighted at 20% each of the complete module.*
